                <p>The first exploration of ideas consisted of a smartphone app, a smartphone widget and a smart watch. The smartphone app allowed users to enter their pick up and drop off location before they drink and essentially schedule an autonomous car for arrival when they are intoxicated. The widget was a simple one button interface on the smartphone that when pressed, would locate the user’s current location for pick up. This idea was scraped due to its simplistic nature as not many screens would have to be designed for a one button interface. For the smart watch, you would set the destination beforehand such as home and once you are ready for pickup, would tap the smartwatch which sends a signal to the autonomous car for pickup. However, all these ideas were fairly similar to one another except that they were on different platforms, so we ended up integrating the features of the widget and smartwatch into the smartphone app to create our first concept.</p>

                <p>Our first concept is the smart phone app designed to keep intoxicated people off the streets and get the home safely by allowing them to call an autonomous car and identifying their location, so they can be picked up. Users can set their pick-up point and destination, time of pick up and will receive a notification on time of arrival so they don’t have to worry about how they will find a way home safely. The app works by having users plan ahead of intoxication so that it will not hinder their ability to make decisions.</p>

                <p>Usability testing was used to measure the efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction of the user when interacting with the app and were able to determine whether the conceptual model of the product matched the user’s mental model. By using a stopwatch, we were able to record the time it took for users to complete certain tasks and with relative ease.Through contextual observation, we observed the user’s facial expressions, actions and posture, revealing a better understanding of the design problems and gathering important feedback for our design. As the user’s progressed through the prototype and spoke their thoughts and expressed their concerns, we were able to find obstacles that disrupt the flow of the interface in specific stages. At the end of the user testing session, we gave the participants a questionnaire making the accuracy and completeness of the information provided reliant of the user’s memory and ability to recall their interactions </p>

                <p>The first set of wireframes for the smartphone app were test with 4 young adults. Various usability methods utilised in the user testing, reveal that there were inconsistencies in the app such as some screens missing navigation bars and buttons were different sizes and shapes making the app confusing to navigate. Furthermore, it was noted that there were missing steps in the process to book the autonomous car such as payment process and scheduling a time and date. Some buttons were also very tiny and would be a strain to read for intoxicated people.</p>
                <p>For the next set of wireframes for the app, we took the feedback from the previous user testing session into consideration. The buttons for users to progress to the next screen were more prominent so that intoxicated people would know to tap it and the general size of the fonts on the app were increased in size. We also moved a lot unnecessary clutter on the screen, so users would not get confused. We began our second session of user testing on the newly iterated wireframes and it was revealed that the app was a lot easier to navigate due to the layout of elements. However, it was noted that user had no control or freedom due to there being no way to progress to next and previous screens and one user said that they would like the fonts to be larger. </p>

                <p>Taking the feedback from users on both wireframes, we added features to the app to make it more understandable for intoxicated people. Buttons are now highlighted when the user is prompted to tap it and selections are to be made. A login screen is now added in accommodation with the payment screen, so users can add money to their account and don’t have to worry about payment when under the influence. Notifications now drop down when the autonomous car has arrived for pick up and drop off to inform users. When user testing the first paper prototype, users had trouble progressing to the next screen since there was no confirm button to proceed on two screens. One user had trouble understanding the location service feature, so we had to intervene and explain it to them. On the next iteration, we would like to clarify certain features to have less words and more visuals.</p>

The design of the app as a whole is very similar to the UBER app so has no real uniqueness that distinguishes it.</p>

The goal of this interface is to encourage intoxicated users to better ways of getting home safely and to deter them from wandering the streets and from drinking under the influence.</p>

We identified obscurities within our interface where the user needed an explanation as to what they were doing and how to proceed. It was further revealed through contextual observation, usability testing, and the think aloud method that there is no way to cancel ordering an autonomous car instantly, so users are forced to keep pressing back until they reach the home screen. We reduced the possibility of user error by utilising the large screen and buttons to make it easier for an intoxicated person to interact with.

We ended up removing the navigation bar circles at the bottom of the screen since users got them confused with buttons and it only added to the clutter. We altered the results page to have a more simplistic yet informative display of the screen with the reduction on the amount of words used and a greater emphasis on graphics since the last thing intoxicated people want to do is read. In addition, we added cancellation buttons that would move the user back to the home screen instantly rather than having to keep pressing back. From user feedback on our 2nd prototype, an additional screen would be desired for people who just want to call an autonomous car as they want to skip the breath test or are not drunk. The interface itself had too many words so a different way to represent the results where anyone can understand it.</p>

                <p>Through feedback from previous prototypes, we decided to use a digital prototyping tool as it would help users give more feedback regarding the actual interface than the visual problems of the paper prototypes. We added additional screens to help the flow of the interactions. A major change was with how users proceed to the next screen. When using Nielson’s 10 usability heuristics as a guideline, key insights were revealed. Users needed to recognise rather than recall. It needed more symbols than words for a faster and more fluent understanding of the interface. The system was also missing key functions such as payment. The aesthetics of the interface was very minimalistic and did not look like an app for a tablet.</p>

                <p>When deciding on which idea to take forward, we had to consider to pros and cons as well as the perspectives of what young adults need more. For our smartphone app concept, multiple users said that it is very similar to already existing transportation apps on the market such as Uber and Lyft. Our team found it very hard to differentiate our concept from these already existing technologies and thought that nothing would stop users from just using the already existing apps since they are familiar with them. On the other hand, there are no other competing interfaces on the market to the breathalyser concept which would entice people to use it even more for a unique experience. Furthermore, we think that the breathalyser concept does a better job at getting intoxicated people home safely as it shows the consequences of driving under the influence and users don’t have to download any app beforehand.</p>

                <p>Through feedback from our tutor, we completely redesigned the aesthetics of the breathalyser interface as it did not look like an app and along with the white background, gave it a very minimalistic and dull look. With the new design, we used a dark background to reduce glare in low light conditions of a bar or club and white text to contrast with it. Screens now slide from right to left to indicate progression to the next screen and left to right to indicate backtracking to a previous screen. </p>

                <p>Alert screens slide in from the top to avoid confusing the user. The app is now consistent so that buttons are in the same place and feel natural to the user, so they will not feel lost on the page. We aimed to reduce error as much as possible. Forwards indicators only show up when the task is completed, and back indicators are not shown on some screens to reduce the likelihood of users accidently aborting while they are undertaking the task on the screen. Simple animation indicators are shown to the user to inform them of the remaining seconds they must blow into the breathalyser for. We have also decided to reinclude the navigation circles on the bottom screen to show how far the user has progressed. During testing, users were confused this feature as buttons, however, we have designed them for when be highlighted when hovered over to avoid confusion.</p>
                <p>We also increased the size of the buttons and fonts to facilitate for intoxicated users with poor control and reduced the amount of words on screen and replaced them with associated iconic symbols.In a previous user testing session, it was pointed out that there is no way for the user to know what the vehicle number of the autonomous car is when it arrives, so we added a screen which includes a vehicle and reference number. Users can also scan a QR code on the screen to be keep these details and be notified when the autonomous car arrives for pickup. In the car selection screen, instead of displaying the company or brand name of the autonomous car, they are relabelled to what is the most essential aspect of the car itself; Economy, Spacious and Luxury.</p>
