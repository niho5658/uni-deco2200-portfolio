          <p>Chauffeur is a tablet application which in conjunction with a breathalyser is able book an autonomous car to pick up intoxicated people and deliver them to their destination based on their detected BAC (Blood alcohol concentration) reading. This interactive device provides a solution to the growing number of alcohol fuelled incidents identified and aim to deliver intoxicated people home in a safe and efficient manner. As a result, we hope to reduce the number of people driving under the influence and alcohol fuelled violence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p> How it works: Chauffeur will be implemented at bars so intoxicated people can interact with the interface at any time. Users are prompted to blow into the breathalyser and are returned with a BAC reading. If the BAC reading is higher than the blood alcohol limit, the system recommends the user to book an autonomous car to return home. Users can adjust their destination and car class in accordance to their circumstance. </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Our first concept is the smart phone app designed to keep intoxicated people off the streets and get the home safely by allowing them to call an autonomous car and identifying their location, so they can be picked up. Users can set their pick-up point and destination, time of pick up and will receive a notification on time of arrival so they don’t have to worry about how they will find a way home safely. The app works by having users plan ahead of intoxication so that it will not hinder their ability to make decisions.</p>
          <p>While designing the interface, it was important to make it as simple and accessible as possible while keeping in mind that intoxicated people would be using this tablet application. I would try to step into the shoes of intoxicated people or people who are not as technology savvy.  This meant for example, that buttons needed to be more prominent, colours had to have sufficient contrast so that it would not have a strain on user’s eyes and font sizes needed to be large enough for legibility. As our team designed the UI, we constantly checked how the design looked on the tablet using Sketch and Invision to ensure legibility on smaller devices.<p>

          <p>Through feedback from user testing, our team identified obscurities within our interface where users needed an explanation as to what they were doing and how to proceed forward due to their being no user control or freedom. Our initial mistake with our early designs were that we were not design with our target users in mind. To combat this and reduce the possibility of user error, we utilised the large screen and made the buttons more prominent for an intoxicated person to interact with. We also received input that results screen that shows you your BAC was all words and they had trouble understanding what it was. As a result, we decided to reduce the number of words and replace them with graphics and iconic symbols to help guide users through the process.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>With guidance from our studio tutor, we redesigned the aesthetics of the interface due to it having a dull and minimalistic look as well as not resembling features of an app. We used a dark background contrasted with white text to reduce glare in low light conditions such as bars and clubs. Screens now show a sliding animation to indicate to the user whether the screens are proceeding or not due to feedback regarding users getting lost. In accompaniment to this, we re-added the navigation bar below to inform users of their current progression in the process to order an autonomous car. We initially removed this feature due to users getting them confused for buttons, however, have adjusted them to look less like buttons and using colour to inform the user of the current screen they are on. To reduce confusion for the user, we made it so indicators to proceed forward only show when the task is completed, and back indicators are purposely not shown on some screens to reduce the likelihood of users accidently aborting while they are undertaking a task on screen.</p>

      <p>Font sizes were also increased to facilitate for intoxicated people with poor control. In a previous user testing session, in was pointed out that there was no way an intoxicated person would remember the booking details, so we added a QR code at the end, so users can keep the details including reference and booking number and be notified when the autonomous car arrives. When selecting a type of car, we replaced the car brands with car classes such as economy and business as users can choose based on their financial status.</p>

        </div>
      </div> 
      <p>Unfortunately, parts of the design process such as user research and user testing were not carried out thoroughly enough possibly due resource or time constraints. If I were to do things differently, I would advocate more time to user testing and try to gain more insight from them to further validate the design of the interface and features. Overall, it has been a valuable learning experience for me. I’ve learned a lot not only about the challenges intoxicated people cause or are faced with and how autonomous cars can solve this but also about new design processes and the world of UI.</p>
